This page builds off of my [Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab](https://github.com/gervguerrero/Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab/tree/main). 

In Microsoft Azure, I built a public facing Honey Net to attract real world cyber attackers to monitor their TTPs. Here I showcase basic methods to view the incidents caused by these threat actors in Microsoft Azure and implement controls to emulate the incident response process from NIST 800-61 used by Security Operation Center (SOC) Teams.
